# Doctrine Laravel Project

A kick-starter project that pre-configures Doctrine, Twig, behaviours and some other stuff
because bootstrapping projects with the same requirements is tedious.

Use this to kick-start a Doctrine based Laravel app.

 * 1.X Laravel 5.2.* based project
 * 2.X Laravel 5.3.* based project

Included are the following:

 * Barryvdh Debugbar
 * Barryvdh IdeHelper
 * Beberlei Assert
 * Doctrine
 * Doctrine Behaviours
 * Doctrine Domain Events
 * Doctrine Entity Audit
 * Doctrine Entity Validation
 * Eloquent Enumerations
 * Environment Loader
 * HTML Builder
 * Homestead
 * Twig
 * Twig Extensions

## Entities

The default namespace is "App".

The following entities and matching repositories are provided, together with YAML mapping
files, pre-configured:

 * Address
 * Country
 * Organization
 * Permission
 * Role
 * User

Each repository has an interface that is pre-mapped to the interface in the repository
config.

### Domain Events

The User and Organization entities support Domain Events:

 * User Events
   * UserCreated
   * UserLoggedIn
   * AddressAddedToEntity
   * AddressRemovedFromEntity
   * AuthenticationCredentialsChanged
   * GrantedOrganizationToUser
   * GrantedPermissionToUser
   * GrantedRoleToUser
   * RevokedOrganizationFromUser
   * RevokedPermissionFromUser
   * RevokedRoleFromUser
 * Organization Events
   * OrganizationCreated
   * AddressAddedToEntity
   * AddressRemovedFromEntity

## Getting Started

 * `composer create-project somnambulist/laravel-doctrine-project my-project`
 * setup your database settings / configure the other options
 * `./artisan doctrine:schema:validate`
 * `./artisan doctrine:schema:create`
 * `./artisan db:seed`
 * `./artisan server`
 * to use Vagrant, update the Homestead.yaml with the project location
